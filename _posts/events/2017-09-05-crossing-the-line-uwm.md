## The Milwaukee Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968 (Exhibit closing)

"How do citizens work for change when faced with injustice? How can individuals make a difference? What can you do to end segregation today?

Interact with a traveling exhibit created by the Wisconsin Historical Society. ""Crossing the Line: The Fair Housing Marches of 1967-1968"" examines the practices and prejudices that led to segregation in Milwaukee and chronicles the school desegregation and fair housing movements of the 1960s."
